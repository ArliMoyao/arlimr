          <div class="well scroll-animate">
            RePlate is a food-sharing app designed to tackle food waste and food insecurity by conenecting those with surplus food to those in need. By creating a cultural shift in how we view food waste, RePlate aims to reduce the environmental impact of food waste and provide food to those in need.
            This project was developed in collaboration with two other Wellesley students and one MIT student for the course <a href="">Software Design! </a>
            Throughout the semester, students learned not just about engineering, but the physical, lingustic, conceptual levels of software design, truly finding a real user need and creating a solution for it.

            <p>
              Up to 40% of food is wasted in the US, contributing to rising carbon emissions. Additionally, 13.5% of US households experience food insecuity. There are efforts that exist to target this issue yet many of them are supervised by third parties creating a disconnect with community-led solutions and destigmatizing food insecurity.

            <h3 style="padding-top: 30px;" class="themeFont">Solution</h3>
            <p>
              Our solution is a food-sharing app that addresses user pain points, successfully bridging the gap between those who are looking for food and those who have food they want to give away. We plan to implement money transactions, exchange rating and reporting systems to limit abusive use patterns, ensuring safety and incentivizing people to participate in food exchanges.

            <h5>NEEDFINDING: CONDUCTING USER INTERVIEWS</h5>
            <p>
              The interviews aimed to explore food surplus and insecurity by speaking with both experts and users. Experts discussed food distribution challenges, solutions, and potential app-based interventions. Users shared their struggles with accessing affordable, nutritious food and their perspectives on a food-sharing app.
              Two experts and two users were interviewed, providing valuable insights for the project.
            </p>
            <h5>Expert Interviews</h5>
            <p>
              For the expert interviewees, we wanted to focus on the primary issues with food surplus and insecurity, how communities address them, what works and what doesn’t. For Lisa, we focused on fresh produce management farmers utilize, and for Sarah, we talked about solutions on college campuses. Gauge interest in an app that connects local producers with buyers.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Sarah - A farmer based in Quetzaltenango, Guatemala, who grows a variety of vegetables and fruits. She markets some of her produce while keeping a portion for personal use.</li>
              <li>Lisa - A student majoring in Environmental Studies at Wellesley College. She is an environmental planner intern as well as a sustainability and environmental advocate.</li>
            </ul>
            <h5>User Interviews</h5>
            <p>
              The focus for user interviews was on the challenges they face in accessing affordable, nutritious food, their experience with food sharing in their community, and their attitudes toward an app for improving food access.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Sveta - A 55-year-old housewife from rural Ukraine. She lives with her husband, while her children are away at college, and prepares most of their meals at home.</li>
              <li>Michael - An MIT student living in a cook-yourself dormitory, also serving as the president of the cooking club.</li>
            </ul>
            <h5 class="themeFont"><strong>Key Finding</strong></h5>
            <p>
              The conducted interviews highlighted the necessity of a food-sharing app, as all participants had experienced the effects of food distribution inequality—whether having an excess of food or facing scarcity. Informal sharing systems were commonly utilized among friends, family, and local communities. For instance, Sarah participates in SCOOP, a campus organization that redistributes leftover food, while Michael's community maintains a shared counter for non-perishable items. Sveta engages in a village group chat with over 1,000 members, where food and produce are frequently exchanged. However, these systems present significant limitations. Sarah's access remains constrained due to dietary restrictions, Michael noted the lack of fresh produce availability, and Sveta found that older listings quickly become buried under new messages.
              Despite existing food-sharing networks, connecting individuals with surplus food to those in need remains a challenge, particularly within smaller communities. Lisa highlighted the difficulties small food producers face in maintaining a stable market. Concerns regarding trust and stigma also emerged, as both Sveta and Michael expressed hesitation about accepting food from strangers, while some interviewees were uncomfortable requesting food assistance.
              Several opportunities for improvement were identified, including the implementation of allergy tags to accommodate dietary restrictions and a monetary transaction feature to support small producers. Addressing the stigma associated with food assistance, fostering a sense of community, and encouraging social connections were also recognized as priorities. To enhance trust and reliability, a rating system was proposed to ensure transparency and accountability within the platform.

            <h4>Value Sensitive Analysis (VSD)</h4>
            <p>
              The Value Sensitive Design (VSD) framework was used to identify and address ethical considerations in the development of the RePlate app. By examining the values of stakeholders, including users, developers, and society as a whole, the VSD framework aims to ensure that the app aligns with ethical principles and promotes positive outcomes and values such as community-building, sustainability, and social responsibility.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Non-targeted use</strong> - One type of user that might be considered nefarious is someone who claims all of the free food on the app, leaving little to none for other community members. Although we don’t want to prevent people from getting what they need, allowing one person to claim everything will prevent other people from having their needs met, and will likely lead to the nefarious user wasting food themselves. Another nefarious user might list food that has gone bad or has otherwise been tampered with. An unknowing user might claim this food and become sick as a result. It is also possible for a user to be unaware that the food that they list has expired.</li>
              <li><strong>Sustained Friendships</strong>- People actively using the app will discover other users who probably share similar interests and values (e.g. environmental sustainability, thrifting, cooking, etc). Because of the geographic proximity of users engaging in food sharing, these friendships can be taken elsewhere. However, there needs to be a way to connect people in the app as well.</li>
              <li><strong>Indirect stakeholders</strong>- When people are missing a single ingredient, they tend to run to a corner store or order delivery. If the app scales up and that needs is met internally, these third parties can lose their demand. However, we cannot possibly have everything in households, and these business are used for other general purposes like regular grocery shopping, which our app does not aim nor is able to replace. Plus, these businesses can be ultimately turned into app users.</li>
              <li><strong>Diverse Geographies</strong>- Cities: People with extra meals, extra food from events/restaurants can participate. Remote/ country side: It could allow farmers to share their surplus or products with more people</li>

                  This design shows the user the amount of money they saved and the amount of Co2 emissions they saved by purchasing foods that are left over at the end of the day that prevented even more food waste.

    adds a new listing containing an author, the name of the item, the quantity of the given item, the meetup location, and an associated image is added to listings; hide is set to false and remaining is set to quantity
    delete(listing: Listing)
    listing gets removed from listings
    edit(listing: Listing, name: string, quantity: integer, img: file)
    listing in listings is edited (either new name, quantity, or image)
